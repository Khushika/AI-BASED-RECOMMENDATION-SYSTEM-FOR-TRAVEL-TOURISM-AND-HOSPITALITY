This 1 staffs are very arrogant and make us wait for so long to complete a already prebooked room. Once done the room they showed was so stinky and bad. Bathrooms are too worst. When asked for change they said we have to wait for a day. We planned for 5 days stay it was all horrible as it was prebooked.

Breakfast is free but not much options only 4-5 items not worth a penny . I think they don't have any kitchen and just getting it near by road side food dealers as we have to wait every day for food to arrive.

No room service available or intercom facility only you need to call the mobile number. Can you image how bad to do this as most of the time the number is busy.

TV is there but not working. We stayed during ICT world cup cricket and not able to see the single match. We have to use our mobile phones or laptop to watch it

House keeping ?? do they really have one???? not cleaned rooms until 4 days we have to use the same bed liners and items. Hope you guys understand our pain.

Location is prime area but most of the rooms are empty due to this customer service.
